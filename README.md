Current ver. 1.4.2b

A horror-maze game which happens to be my first 3D Unity game. 

WASD to move.

Objective: Find the goal at the centre of the map before the creature finds you.
           You'll know when it does.
           


Includes external resources, as noted in the credits.
However, I contributed a few, including:
  -Map --> Fully built in Blender and texture/normalmapped within Unity
  -Models --> textured, rigged and animated in Mixamo/Fuse
